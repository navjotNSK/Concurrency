    Use @Before when you need to do something before a method executes (e.g., logging, security checks).
    Use @AfterReturning to work with the result of a method.
    Use @AfterThrowing to handle exceptions specifically.
    Use @After for cleanup activities that should run regardless of method success or failure.
    Use @Around for full control over method execution, to modify arguments or return values, or to implement complex conditional behavior around the method call.
